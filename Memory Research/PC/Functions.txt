PTLE+227EB0
- Related to game updates
- On disable, everything stops moving, but rendering is still on
- Pause menu still works too

	call PTLE+2280B0 : Disabling it causes debris to remain static
	call PTLE+2252A0 : DON'T TOUCH, IT CRASHES
	call PTLE+2B48A0 : ???

	+227F17 : for loop
		+227F59 : call dword [edx+2C] : Polymorphic update function!?
		For loop stops on [ebp-08] == 0, so null pointer
		[ebp-08] seems to be a pointer to a 32-bits entry inside a double-linked list
		Each entry contains a pointer to the entity (the actual vtable thing)
		Next entry is at offset 0x10.
